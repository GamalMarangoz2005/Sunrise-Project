# Sunrise Project
Sunrise Project is a system for measuring the brightness of an ambient environment. 
The system measures the brightness in percentage by measuring the maximum brightness in the current environment by using 
a feature called self-calibration and then, based on the maximum measurement it measures the light in your environment and 
divide it on the maximum value measured from the self-calibration mode; providing precision in light measuring and make the 
measurements relative to the environment the system is used for.

## Features
1. Self-Calibration Mode
   The self-calibration mode is activated with a push button and blinking LED, that waits for the
   user to take the maximum brightness measurement and then, once the sensor reads the value as the user
   wishes the user press the button again to deactivate the calibration mode and the LED blinking stops; indicating
   that we are in the operational mode.
   
2. 10-Segment LED Graph Bar
   The LED Graph bar containing 10-segments and each segment indicating 10% portion which displays the light intensity 
   in the bar for a simple visual demonstration of the reading without the hastle of precise number measurements.
